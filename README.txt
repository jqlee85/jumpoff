== Frequently Asked Questions ==

=How does it work?=
Just click a button and you’ll receive a randomly generated prompt to get the brain firing. Then write until it stops you. We call these exercises "Flows." The purpose of the exercise is stream-of-consciousness writing. Don't overthink, don't edit, just write the first thing that comes to your mind and keep moving.

=Why can't I delete text or go back?=
This is intentional. By removing the ability to edit your flows, fix your typos, or second-guess your word choice, we free you up to stay in a state of flow. When the exercise is done, you can edit all you want, but for now, just keep getting thoughts from brain to screen. We hope to help inspire creative writing of all sorts, and make writing as simple as possible, so you can do it every day.

=What happens to the writing?=
It’s up to you. When you’re done with one prompt you can click done to start another Flow, or open your writing as a Post draft and edit, shape or add to it. At the end of every Flow, JumpOff will save all your writing and the prompts that inspired it. You can access/edit old Flows in the My Flows section.

=Can I publish Flows?=
Not yet. Flows are writing exercises that aren't meant to be published themselves, but from the Flow's edit page, you can clone the flow as a Post, then publish that post.

=What are the stars?=
You can star Flows for any reason you like, but we like to star the writing we want to revisit. Maybe we want to develop an idea further, or create a blog post, short story, novel or piece of art inspired by one of our Flows.

=What are the numbers in the dashboard widget?=
The "Flow Streak" number is your current number of consecutive days doing at least one Flow exercise. The "Last 30 Days" number is the number of Flow exercises completed in the last 30 days. Simple enough, huh?

=I have an idea about how to improve JumpOff, who do I tell?=
Email jesse@jumpoff.io, We're always looking for ways to make JumpOff more useful, so we love getting feedback, positive or negative.
